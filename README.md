## üöÄ Features

We've created this admin panel for everyone who wants to create templates based on our pre-made components. Our mission is to deliver a user-friendly, clear and easy administration panel that can be used by both simple websites and sophisticated systems. The only requirement is basic HTML and CSS (and some [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki)) knowledge ‚Äî as a reward, you'll be able to manage and visualize different types of data in the easiest possible way!

* **Responsive:** With the support for mobile, tablet and desktop displays, it doesn‚Äôt matter what device you‚Äôre using. Tabler is responsive in all major browsers.
* **Cross Browser:** Our theme works perfectly with the latest Chrome, Firefox+, Safari, Opera, Edge and mobile browsers. We work hard to to provide continuous support for them.

sudo xcode-select --install
```
5. Run NPM
	```npm run start```


**Windows users**:

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) in `C:\Program Files\git\bin` directory and run `npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"` to change the default shell.

3. [Read guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.

Once you complete the setup, you'll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.


## Build locally

You need to have `npm` and `bundler` installed.

1. From the root `/tabler` directory, run installation in the command line:
  - `npm install` 
  - `bundler install` 
2. Then execute `npm run start-plugins` to start up the application stack.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, and voil√†.
4. Any change in the `/src` directory will build the application and refresh the page.

**Note**:
Run `npm run build` for reforms a one off build application without refresh.
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to configure the Web server.

## Installation

Tabler is distributed via npm.

```sh
npm install --save @tabler/core
```

## Running with Docker

If you don't want to install node/npm/ruby and the dependencies on your local environment, you can use the provided Dockerfile to build a docker image.
This Dockerfile is provided as an example to spin-up a container running Tabler.

Example of how to use this image:

1. Build the tabler image : `docker build -t tabler .`
2. Run the tabler image while mounting the `src` directory as well as the `_config.yml` file into the container.

Don't forget to expose the port 3000 so you can browse the website locally.
You can also expose the port 3001 to have access to BrowserSync

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -v $(pwd)/src:/app/src -v $(pwd)/_config.yml:/app/_config.yml tabler
```

Now open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Edit anything in the `src/` folder and watch your browser refresh the page after it has been rebuilt.


### CDN support

All files included in `@tabler/core` npm package are available over a CDN.
